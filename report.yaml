title: "The Heterogeneous Effects of Government Spending: It's All about Taxes"
praise: ""
requests:
    - *requirements
    - *cite_data 
    - In particular, where do DATA_MACRO_FN.csv and DATA_STATE_FN.csv come from?
    - Please add to the README file the estimated time required to run the replication package.
    - The Figures 12 and 21 generated by the Matlab "EMPIRICAL/FIGURE_8_12_21.m" code are different from the figures in the manuscript, even though Figure 8 is correct.
    - *stata_packages
    - The RHS plot in figure 24 generated by the Matlab and Stata codes "EMPIRICAL/FIGURE_24.m" and "EMPIRICAL/LPM_FIGURE_24.do" is diffrent from the plot in the manuscript.
    - There is a typo in the "README.pdf" on page 5 in the description of Figure 26. In code "EMPIRICAL/LPM_FIGURE_26.do" the case is not selected on line 24 but 43. 
    - The figure 29 generated by the Matlab and Stata codes "EMPIRICAL/FIGURE_28_29.m" and "EMPIRICAL/LPM_FIGURE_28_29.do" is diffrent from the figure in the manuscript.
recommendations:
    - Please use case sensitive paths and filenames in your scriipts and commands as unix systems are case sensitive.
    - *relative_path
    - Please consider introducing changes in your Stata codes (for example "EMPIRICAL/LPM_FIGURE_23.do") in a way that would not require from a reader to run the code 3 times changing values in the code. It would be easier for the future reader if this (and all other similiar Stata files) would run in loops automatically changing the desired values.
