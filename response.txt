Dear Gaston,

Thank you for sending the replication materials for "The Heterogeneous Effects of Government Spending: It's All about Taxes" to the Review. 

To help our readers replicate your results, my team and I have reviewed the code, data and documentation you have submitted.

To comply with our Data Availability Policy, please make the following changes:

1. Please describe the computational requirements for running your package. See https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/template_README/template-README.html#computational-requirements for explanation and examples.
2. Add data citations in the README as well as the manuscript for each dataset you use, whether you include it in the package or not. Citing data sources in the manuscript is the best was of directing readers to them. Please see here (https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/guidance/addtl-data-citation-guidance.html) for examples and further guidance.
3. In particular, where do DATA_MACRO_FN.csv and DATA_STATE_FN.csv come from?
4. Please add to the README file the estimated time required to run the replication package.
5. The Figures 12 and 21 generated by the Matlab "EMPIRICAL/FIGURE_8_12_21.m" code are different from the figures in the manuscript, even though Figure 8 is correct.
6. Add all Stata packages to the README that you use with instructions on how to install them.
7. The RHS plot in figure 24 generated by the Matlab and Stata codes "EMPIRICAL/FIGURE_24.m" and "EMPIRICAL/LPM_FIGURE_24.do" is diffrent from the plot in the manuscript.
8. There is a typo in the "README.pdf" on page 5 in the description of Figure 26. In code "EMPIRICAL/LPM_FIGURE_26.do" the case is not selected on line 24 but 43.
9. The figure 29 generated by the Matlab and Stata codes "EMPIRICAL/FIGURE_28_29.m" and "EMPIRICAL/LPM_FIGURE_28_29.do" is diffrent from the figure in the manuscript.

In addition, please consider the following recommendations to ease reproducibility:

1. Please use case sensitive paths and filenames in your scriipts and commands as unix systems are case sensitive.
2. Replace absolute paths in the scripts with relative paths. Let readers know which folder to run your code from and use paths relative to that.
3. Please consider introducing changes in your Stata codes (for example "EMPIRICAL/LPM_FIGURE_23.do") in a way that would not require from a reader to run the code 3 times changing values in the code. It would be easier for the future reader if this (and all other similiar Stata files) would run in loops automatically changing the desired values.

After you have made these changes, please upload the revision to Zenodo and send me the link to the new version. 

When creating the new version, please edit the date of the Zenodo record to reflect when you have made the changes. Please keep the Trello email address in the "cc" of your reply email, so that we can properly track your package in our system.

Best regards,

Miklos
